It is because of one feature that I have been waiting for for so long&amp;hellip; Smart Merge.
Logseq checked all the boxes for me It is my main note taking app, my [[PKM]], and my [[second brain]].
There are so many more great things about Logseq, but when it comes down to the deal breakers these were high on my list and believe me I have tried many apps and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any that can do all of these things as well as Logseq.</description></item></channel></rss>
