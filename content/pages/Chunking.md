AI, the digital version of our brain is very good at it as well.

[[Pattern Recognition]] is a compression algorithm. Evolution favoured optimization.

In order for human brains to understand and make use of AI's knowledge it must be rendered in the right way that a human can understand.



Large Language Models as compression of knowledge.
