People who are ok with how things are don&amp;rsquo;t do much and that&amp;rsquo;s ok.
People who want change do things. Things that are good many other things that are bad. We tend to judge lazy people but the bigger problems come from industrious people who do things that end up being a net negative.</description></item><item><title>Doing the same thing</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/doing-the-same-thing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/doing-the-same-thing/</guid><description>‚ÄúInsanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.‚Äù ‚Äî [[Albert Einstein]]</description></item><item><title>What if I've never tasted wine?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ive-never-tasted-wine/</link><pubDate>Thu, 10 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ive-never-tasted-wine/</guid><description>Thinking about the impressive capabilities of LLM these days, I thought of some other takes on the [[Turing test]], or the [[Chinese room]] idea.

And like many people who live abroad, because I only get to see Korea once in a while, I tend to notice the changes. Korea definitely is a place that has a lot of new things to notice. There is always something new and different. After Gangnam Style, BTS, Parasite, and of course Covid&amp;hellip; This time things felt a lot more different.</description></item><item><title>Logseq version 9.10 Smart Merge feature</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/logseq-version-9.10-smart-merge-feature/</link><pubDate>Thu, 29 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/logseq-version-9.10-smart-merge-feature/</guid><description>Logseq today just (4 hours ago) released Version 9.10 So why am I so excited about this release that I am writing about it?
It is because of one feature that I have been waiting for for so long&amp;hellip; Smart Merge.
Logseq checked all the boxes for me It is my main note taking app, my [[PKM]], and my [[second brain]].
There are so many more great things about Logseq, but when it comes down to the deal breakers these were high on my list and believe me I have tried many apps and I can&amp;rsquo;t think of any that can do all of these things as well as Logseq.</description></item><item><title>What would The Last (insert product here) you ever need to buy look like?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-would-the-last-insert-product-here-you-ever-need-to-buy-look-like/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Jun 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-would-the-last-insert-product-here-you-ever-need-to-buy-look-like/</guid><description>Image generated by [[DiffusionBee app]] using the prompt &amp;ldquo;What would the last cup you ever need to buy look like?&amp;rdquo;
In the world where consumerism, fast fashion, instant, single use, and [[designed obsolescence]] is the most profitable business practice. What would the last product you need to buy look like?
The Last cup
The Last shoe
The Last bag
The Last jacket
The Last car
The Last house?

Maybe I can share my packing checklist. Strangely enough, this is one of my most used templates! Compiled over time from my past mistakes.

It used to be a philosophical question, but now it has become a more practical, technology question. Apple just announced the [[Vision Pro]].

Where am I going? Where do I want to be?
I just turned 49 and I still don&amp;rsquo;t have a clear answer to these questions&amp;hellip; Now I just accepted that my life is about wandering.
I think J.R.R Tolkien and Adel both once said
&amp;ldquo;Not all those who wander are lost.&amp;rdquo;
Once I realized that is what I am good at, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t feel so bad. The book üìñ Delivered From Distraction described brains like mine as &amp;ldquo;Chronic wandering of the mind&amp;rdquo;.</description></item><item><title>Why do I need a thinking tool?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/why-do-i-need-a-thinking-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/why-do-i-need-a-thinking-tool/</guid><description>‚ÄúA Bicycle for the mind‚Äù.

Who is really benefiting from the higher price of homes?
Maybe you are one of the lucky people who bought low and sold high.
Maybe you got into the real estate game before a lot of other people and have a lot of properties that are making profit for you.

There is nothing like feeling sick that drains any little motivation that I have left inside.
Physically painful, no energy, no will
Negative thought spiral
Just overall making me feel bad about everything.
I really am grateful for being generally healthy&amp;hellip;
My habit is barely propping me up. But it is working.
The reason I am even writing this is because I have a system that I set up using Complice.</description></item><item><title>What if AI makes money</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/</guid><description>There has been no lack of AI anxiety going around. So let me just throw another idea out there.
What if AI makes money?
Of course it will be programmed to make money on its own.
Of course it is already better at a lot of things than most people.
Of course it will be better at doing everything even making money very soon.
AutoGPT already demonstrated that when given a goal an AI program can figure out how to achieve that goal.</description></item><item><title>They say AI is going to take my job.

So much is swirling around us so fast no human can possibly keep up. It will only get exponentially faster I suppose.
Welcome to the singularity. What I see happening very soon, which is exciting to investors and businesses but scary and sad for workers is that everyone will start working on a last project that will train the AI to replace their own job.</description></item><item><title>Creator collective</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/creator-collective/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/creator-collective/</guid><description>We hear over and over that creativity is always one of the best skill to have for the future.
Forbes says &amp;ldquo;Creativity will be one of the most desirable skills in the future workplace&amp;rdquo;*
WEF puts &amp;ldquo;Creativity, originality and initiative&amp;rdquo; among the top 10 skills of 2025.*
But why do so many creatives struggle? I start with the Big Questions
&amp;ldquo;What if creators were valued as much as business people?&amp;rdquo;</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT is getting crazy</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</guid><description>Trying to learn what I can do with ChatGPT and found this.

What good is a wallet with only one bill inside? You might ask&amp;hellip; Well, it was a magical wallet. I would be able to take the bill out and use it. Then magically another one appeared inside this magical wallet. Wouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be nice?

Finally, after struggling year after year from seasonal allergies, my past self, one day in 2010 realized he needs to do something about it. He sent a message to me today in the future in 2023.
I hope you never experience seasonal allergies, or any other allergies for that matter, it really sucks.</description></item><item><title>The Santa Paradox</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/the-santa-paradox/</link><pubDate>Thu, 09 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/the-santa-paradox/</guid><description>I was thinking about consciousness. Then I had a moment of profound realization. You know the moment you go from not knowing to knowing something. Our brain probably evolved to reward these moments since it feels so good when this happens. This must be the motivation for all the curious minds. Joy of learning I suppose.
