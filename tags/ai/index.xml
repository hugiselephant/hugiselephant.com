What if I&amp;rsquo;ve never tasted wine before but I can fake it.
A blind person describing the color red.
If a car can drive as good as a human, then does it have awareness of the road like the human driver?
I suppose the Chinese room uses knowledge of Chinese as an analogy for consciousness.</description></item><item><title>Why do I need a thinking tool?</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/why-do-i-need-a-thinking-tool/</link><pubDate>Wed, 17 May 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/why-do-i-need-a-thinking-tool/</guid><description>“A Bicycle for the mind”. That’s what Steve Jobs called the computer back in the 90’s, because it was a tool that made our limited human mind more efficient. Now imagine, driving past the old bicycle on a new “self-driving car for your mind”. I think it’s time we get a little upgrade.
Let’s think about thinking, just bear with me for a minute&amp;hellip;
We all have a lot of “knowledge work” to do these days.</description></item><item><title>What if AI makes money</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/</link><pubDate>Wed, 26 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/</guid><description>There has been no lack of AI anxiety going around. So let me just throw another idea out there.
What if AI makes money?
Of course it will be programmed to make money on its own.
Of course it is already better at a lot of things than most people.
Of course it will be better at doing everything even making money very soon.
AutoGPT already demonstrated that when given a goal an AI program can figure out how to achieve that goal.</description></item><item><title>They say AI is going to take my job.

So much is swirling around us so fast no human can possibly keep up. It will only get exponentially faster I suppose.
Welcome to the singularity. What I see happening very soon, which is exciting to investors and businesses but scary and sad for workers is that everyone will start working on a last project that will train the AI to replace their own job.</description></item><item><title>ChatGPT is getting crazy</title><link>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</link><pubDate>Tue, 28 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://hugiselephant.com/pages/chatgpt-is-getting-crazy/</guid><description>Trying to learn what I can do with ChatGPT and found this. Seems like imagination is the only limiting factor.

So I tried it too. I didn&amp;rsquo;t even have to do the first set up prompt. All I asked was one line.
