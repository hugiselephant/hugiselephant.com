We can divide people into two groups people who want change, people who are ok with how it is.

People who are ok with how things are don't do much and that's ok.

People who want change do things. Things that are good many other things that are bad. We tend to judge lazy people but the bigger problems come from industrious people who do things that end up being a net negative.

Made me think of the [[Von Hammerstein matrix]]

It seems getting enough people who do things to go the same direction is hard.
