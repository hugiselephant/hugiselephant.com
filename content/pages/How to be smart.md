What does it mean to be smart?

It used to be that if you remembered a lot of things you would be smart.

You pass more tests, you go on quiz shows and people will come to you for knowledge.



Technology tends to level the playing field. Now that we have the interned in our pockets remembering things is no longer necessary.



So what does it mean to be smart?

  + more memory

  + faster recall

  + better decision making

  + correct model of the world



Better decision making = better information x better action



So now that information and intelligence is becoming abundant. What matters more and more is the better action.
