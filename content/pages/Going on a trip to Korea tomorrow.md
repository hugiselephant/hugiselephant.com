I'm going to Korea tomorrow and I am still not packed... So I don't have time to post anything longer.

Maybe I can share my packing checklist. Strangely enough, this is one of my most used templates! Compiled over time from my past mistakes. Every time I leave something behind and think, "I wish I had brought this on my trip..." I put it in this list. Very useful for me on every trip.
