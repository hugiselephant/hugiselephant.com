instead of passively wishing for something to happen I decided that I will plan for joy in my life. Big or small changing the things that I can control like my environment, people around me, arranging objects and space that I spend most of my time, and people that I spend time the most to make my world more likely to create joy is as good of a goal as any other...



Sharing with others what I want more in my life brings more of it into my life. - That kind of sounds like how [[Karma]] works. So if I want More joy in my life I will work on creating and sharing joy with other people.
