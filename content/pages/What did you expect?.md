Life is a bit messy, imperfect, never like what you think. Of course how can it be.

It's not about expecting less. Just know that what ever you are thinking is only going to be different than what the real world is going to be. It's about expecting that things will be different.

Be grateful when thing go according to plan. But don't be disappointed when things are different than what was expected.

I mean really what did you expect?
