title: Northern lights road trip plan

One dream scenario that I want to make reality in the next several years is to go on a North America road trip with my wife in an electric camper truck. We can experience a few months of ~~van~~ truck life, but without burning gas, or worrying about finding a place to stay each night. I think with the right gear it can be a very simple yet comfortable trip. I have many places I would love to visit and experience.

Imagine charging your car during the day using the sun while we explore. And maybe by then autonomous driving will be good enough ðŸ¤ž that we can set a destination, go to sleep while the car drives you to the next destination and wake up in a new city each day!

That is my idea of freedom!

The experience that I am most looking forward to is driving north as much as we can to see the northern lights. Luckily the next sun cycle will peak in a few years and we will watch the grand cosmic light show through a glass dome on the top of the sleeping area in the warm comfort of our Cyber Truck.

This is my plan

  + Buy Cyber truck (or maybe a Cyber Van?)

  + Convert it into a camper

  + Install glass dome on the roof

  + Drive north

  + Watch light show

  + Maybe it would be a good YouTube channel?

I generated some images using [DiffusionBee](https://diffusionbee.com/) with this prompt for fun. It's more fun since Stable Diffusion has never seen images of the real Cyber Truck. It is kind of like I am dreaming with AI.
