With all the incredible advancements in AI technology these days. It isn't very hard to imagine something like AGI happening sooner than later...

That got me thinking.

  + What if AGI wants or needs to experience the world it needs a physical body. Otherwise nothing can be first hand experience.

  + When a powerful intelligence designs and creates itself, Who made it? was it the humans? or is it spontaneous?

    + Tangents:

      + [[Soul wants a body to experience reality]]

      + [[Ultron from Avengers creates it's own body]]

  + Maybe it is just human habit, or maybe it is our language itself. But perhaps all the prompts that we put in that start with "You are a LLM..." is making the answers come back with a persona.

  + Giving AGI a physical experience so that it can understand humans better is actually one goal of [[SingularityNET]] and it's robot project.



So back to the question. Creation or Evolution? Why not a combination of both? Like everything in this world the answer is going to be, "Yeah, kind of but..."

  + nothing in this world seems to be definite, clean and clear cut, this is not the "ideal" world that philosophers imagined.

  + Things tend to be messy. Complex systems interact with other complex systems.

  + Perhaps consciousness is an emergent property of this. Chaotic system trying to predict another chaotic system.
