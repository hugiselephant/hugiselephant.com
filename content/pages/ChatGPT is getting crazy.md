Trying to learn what I can do with ChatGPT and found this. Seems like imagination is the only limiting factor.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t care that it’s not AGI, GPT-4 is an incredible and transformative technology. <br><br>I recreated the game of Pong in under 60 seconds. <br>It was my first try. <br><br>Things will never be the same. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gpt4?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#gpt4</a> <a href="https://t.co/8YMUK0UQmd">pic.twitter.com/8YMUK0UQmd</a></p>&mdash; Pietro Schirano (@skirano) <a href="https://twitter.com/skirano/status/1635736107949195278?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2023</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
