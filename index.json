[{"content":"It\u0026rsquo;s been 5 years since my last visit to Korea. And like many people who live abroad, because I only get to see Korea once in a while, I tend to notice the changes. Korea definitely is a place that has a lot of new things to notice. There is always something new and different. After Gangnam Style, BTS, Parasite, and of course Covid\u0026hellip; This time things felt a lot more different. It made me thing about what I call the Speed of Korea.\nOrder - Chaos scale\nIf I were to draw a line with one side having perfect order and the other having complete chaos.\nKorea used to be very close to the chaotic side.\norderless, all rules were breakable,\nAccidents, building collapse, bridge collapse,\nCorruption was everywhere, police, government,\nCheating, gangs, con, taking advantage of others,\nshady Business practices\nFast, incomplete,\nThat was the Korea I grew up in. I\u0026rsquo;m sure all of this is still around. But now it is way closer to the order side. Just in a kind of chaotic \u0026ldquo;Korean\u0026rdquo; way.\nStill in many parts of the world Chaos seems to be the norm\nI get to enjoy the clean spacious, stable society and environment of Canada now.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve only traveled to a few places in the world. So I admit most of my opinion is what I\u0026rsquo;ve learned through media. So I have a narrow perspective.\nWell one place I\u0026rsquo;ve been to is Vietnam. And like Vietnam many South Asian countries looked like there wasn\u0026rsquo;t any traffic rules.\nThe other day I was watching a travel show about India. I feel like it\u0026rsquo;s closer to the chaos side than Korea ever was. Maybe other than some times during the war.\nThere has been many news of accidents, failures, and corruption, in China that reminds me of things that used to happen a lot in Korea.\nSo, How is it that through its chaos, Korea somehow managed to improve so quickly? What were the ingredients that allowed for course correction?\nI can\u0026rsquo;t say for sure but here are some thoughts I had during my trip this time around.\nBalance, or tug of war, of contrasting forces, maybe seen in the yin yang symbol in the Korean national flag\u0026hellip;\nHistorical, culturally, rules, social hierarchy, structure, and historical tragedy that forced a hard reset?\nFamily oriented social structures, modern westernized individualism.\nHurry hurry culture, impatience is a virtue. turned out to be the drive for innovation, change. Many things like this that was what we though of as Korean\u0026rsquo;s weakness that turned around to be our strength.\nI like order, there is a perfectionist side of me that like to organize things in a straight line.\nI guess the moral of this story it that\u0026hellip;\nThere is value in the messiness that people bring. When everyone is trying to take care of themselves some amazing things can emerge from the chaos.\nOrder means rules, regulations, centralized power,\n(Insert a Quote about how people like to tell other people what to do. But I can\u0026rsquo;t find right now\u0026hellip;) Chaos means messy, mixing of decentralized humans, emergence of something unexpected beautiful and surprising that no one can plan.\nOrder is not restriction. Chaos needs some minimal structure to thrive.\nAs always, this thread of thinking needs more exploration\u0026hellip;\n","permalink":"https://hugiselephant.com/pages/speed-of-korea/","summary":"It\u0026rsquo;s been 5 years since my last visit to Korea.

It is so obvious these days that it\u0026rsquo;s kind of embarrassing to be so excited about this common feature.\nI think because Logseq is also about Local first Syncing had been secondary. Sync across devices had been possible in a few different ways for a while now but it was honestly one of the most painful thing about Logseq. It works but it wasn\u0026rsquo;t reliable.\nIt almost became a deal breaker. I almost gave up using Logseq.\nAnd today with this new version, one of those rough edges have been fixed.\nSo what is Smart Merge? One of the worst thing a [[PKM]] system can do is to lose some information you have entered.\nWithout the confidence that you can save something and rely on it 100% makes you question everything in the system.\nIt just sucks when you lose something.\nThere was a possibility when you make edits in two different devices. One version could override the other. You had to manually keep track and make sure the sync was complete before making new edits.\nSmart Merge fixes this by merging your changes.\nIt is still a beta feature so I think you need to be a supporter to get it. But I was so happy that I was able to get this update on both desktop and iOS at the same time. Usually the iOS version comes out a bit later. I guess it made sense to release at the same time for this feature.\nWhat does this mean? This means I don\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about losing some writing I did on one device while offline. Sometimes when I don\u0026rsquo;t notice that I was offline those changes would be lost. But I tried testing going offline and making different edits in two different devices and it merged all the edits without losing any information! Great!\nI can go on long airplane flights without worrying that I will lose those changes.\nIt will open up opportunities for multiple people editing the same page at the same time!\nI have been building anticipation for version 10. I believe it will be in a stable state that I can confidently recommend to people. I hope that time is very soon.\n","permalink":"https://hugiselephant.com/pages/logseq-version-9.10-smart-merge-feature/","summary":"Logseq today just (4 hours ago) released Version 9.10 So why am I so excited about this release that I am writing about it?\nIt is because of one feature that I have been waiting for for so long\u0026hellip; Smart Merge.\nLogseq checked all the boxes for me It is my main note taking app, my [[PKM]], and my [[second brain]].\nThere are so many more great things about Logseq, but when it comes down to the deal breakers these were high on my list and believe me I have tried many apps and I can\u0026rsquo;t think of any that can do all of these things as well as Logseq.","title":"Logseq version 9.10 Smart Merge feature"},{"content":" Image generated by [[DiffusionBee app]] using the prompt \u0026ldquo;What would the last cup you ever need to buy look like?\u0026rdquo;\nIn the world where consumerism, fast fashion, instant, single use, and [[designed obsolescence]] is the most profitable business practice.

Light cannot exist without darkness, opposing emotions, conflicting goals, no pain no gain, yin and yang?

A much bigger version that works in a much more powerful way. It effects everyone in the world and it is called inflation. Whenever new money is created they are in essence steeling from everyone else in the world without you realizing.\nSo who is able to create new money in today\u0026rsquo;s world? Why are they allowed to do it?\nAn interesting opposite fact is that, when money is destroyed or lost everyone is getting richer! I used to worry about all the Bitcoin that gets lost for various reasons. But Michael Saylor pointed this out in this interview.\nThe truth is, you can self-custody your money and on your deathbed you can gift it to whatever cause you want and the default, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have a better idea, you die with your private keys in your head and you gift it pro rata fairly and equitably to every other person that got you to where you were — Michael Saylor\n","permalink":"https://hugiselephant.com/pages/a-magical-wallet-that-steals-money-from-everyone-in-the-world/","summary":"When I was young I wished that I had a magical wallet that had one paper bill inside.\nWhat good is a wallet with only one bill inside?

He sent a message to me today in the future in 2023.\nI hope you never experience seasonal allergies, or any other allergies for that matter, it really sucks. Mine usually gets worse around spring and fall. My eyes and nose start feeling itchy, but I would usually miss the early signs. That is until one day it gets so bad that my eyes would constantly tear up, I can\u0026rsquo;t stop sneezing, my nose would be so runny and so sensitive that I can\u0026rsquo;t function for the whole day. That is when I would take allergy pills but it is too late. I am stuck in bed hoping for the symptoms to go away and it\u0026rsquo;s difficult to even open my eyes or breath through my nose.\nSo after several years of that pain, I finally recognize that there is a pattern. And figure out that maybe there is something I can do about it.\nHere is the mental model of this story.\nEvent → Recognize → Knowing → Understanding → Strategizing -\u0026gt; Acting → Change Starting from the thing that happens, then first noticing or recognizing that—pain usually helps with this step, then realizing that something can be done about it for the better, then coming up with good ideas that would actually work, then remembering to act on it at the right time which is usually in the future when most likely you have forgotten all about this whole thing—and the pain that comes with it. I think being smart, or being wise means you can go through these steps faster. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t very smart or wise. It took me a long time and a lot of pain for me to go through these steps. I was stuck on the knowing about it but not doing anything about it part for a very long time.\nI noticed it\u0026rsquo;s not easy though, there are hard parts, namely the following challenges.\nTracking something over a long period of time\nKnowing and understanding something enough correctly in order to do the next step,\nComing up with good ideas that work\nAbility to act on it at the right time, or remembering to act on it at the right time in the future\nEach of these things are hard. But the last part, especially remembering the right thing to do at the right time in the future could be very hard.\nThat is what I call sending a message to the future and I have a few ways now to make sure I get the right message at the right time. Calendar reminders using repeating calendar events for annual or longer time periods. Future dated reminders using reminder apps, email snoozing, daily routine reminders, morning prompts, going to bed prompts, to do lists just to name a few\u0026hellip;\nI know, these things are pretty common tools. Many people use it every day. Maybe it\u0026rsquo;s not such a big deal. But at least for me, the way I use it, the way I write the message to myself in these reminders, or the way I think about it makes a big difference in how it actually changes my actions and my thinking. Understanding that I can influence my future self with a properly constructed message delivered just in the right moment is key.\nIt is an evolving system that is still changing. I want to retire a few of these and stick with the method that works the best. Whatever the method it must be consistent and reliable for it to work. Building a habit of using this system consistently and reliably is the other half of the system that insures that the message is read at the right time by future me.\nOne thing I am currently working on is contextual, or conditional messages.\nSometimes you want to send a message to a certain situation that is not a fixed time in the future. For instance the reminder app can be triggered when you are at a store, or when you are messaging someone. These are very powerful ways to plan ahead, premeditate, in order to change the future. This one is harder to send the message to the right moment since it can be hard to sense the context and predict, but with the right system and trigger it would be possible and very effective.\nOnce \u0026ldquo;Sending a message to the future\u0026rdquo; starts working, it feels like I can send a message to myself in any time and situation in the future and then it will help me to change something for the better. It almost feels like I am programming myself in the future. In that way, sending a message to the future is a subset of another powerful idea which is Programming my brain.\nRight now I am trying to set up a message to send to myself in the future moment of when I start drinking beer. I need the right message that will help me drink less beer. This is a hard one because I know how much my future self loves beer. I also know after a few beers I will easily ignore my messages from the past self. I need to improve the message and trigger for it to work at all.\nSo what message would you send to your future self? When would you send it to? Or to what situation would you send it to? Is there something you want to change?\nTry sending a message to the future. You might be able to change it!\n","permalink":"https://hugiselephant.com/pages/sending-a-message-to-the-future/","summary":"I just got a message from the past. \u0026ldquo;Allergy attack 2010\u0026rdquo; It\u0026rsquo;s a message from my past self who is living in 2010 suffering painfully from a bad seasonal allergy attack.\nFinally, after struggling year after year from seasonal allergies, my past self, one day in 2010 realized he needs to do something about it.
