Where am I? Where am I going? Where do I want to be?

I just turned 49 and I still don't have a clear answer to these questions... Now I just accepted that my life is about wandering.



I think J.R.R Tolkien and Adel both once said

> "Not all those who wander are lost."



Once I realized that is what I am good at, it doesn't feel so bad. The book ðŸ“– Delivered From Distraction described it Chronic wandering of the mind.
