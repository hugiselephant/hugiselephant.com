I woke up with pain in my toes. I had been wearing socks that were a tiny bit smaller than my feet.

There are things in life that you don't notice at the time but after a long time you realize that it is causing pain.

Reminded me of the time I started wearing ear plugs at night because I realized I wasn't getting enough sleep because of how sensitive I was to the sound in the morning. Those damn early birds... Anyway, it felt fine when I put them on but when I woke up the slight pressure in the ear turned into a big pain in the morning.

Our old place kind of felt like that.

It was fine. We were pretty happy there. We spent Covid there. But now that we are living with slightly more space.  I realize how small and uncomfortable the last place was.

That makes me think, I don't think a bigger place is always good. Perhaps there is a just right size? Mama bear size? I suppose the sock that fits your feet is the most comfortable size right.



So I made a list of all the things I am grateful for at my new place. [[New home grateful list]]
