What if AI makes money?
Of course it will be programmed to make money on its own.
Of course it is already better at a lot of things than most people.
Of course it will be better at doing everything even making money very soon.
AutoGPT already demonstrated that when given a goal an AI program can figure out how to achieve that goal."><meta name=author content="Sung Hong"><link rel=canonical href=https://hugiselephant.com/pages/what-if-ai-makes-money/><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.min.49b1c3611e5e823e974d0b9b3e1101617fce26c004757161abb1a1e4af3ff85c.css integrity="sha256-SbHDYR5egj6XTQubPhEBYX/OJsAEdXFhq7Gh5K8/+Fw=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><script defer crossorigin=anonymous src=/assets/js/highlight.min.b95bacdc39e37a332a9f883b1e78be4abc1fdca2bc1f2641f55e3cd3dabd4d61.js integrity="sha256-uVus3DnjejMqn4g7Hni+Srwf3KK8HyZB9V4809q9TWE=" onload=hljs.initHighlightingOnLoad()></script>
